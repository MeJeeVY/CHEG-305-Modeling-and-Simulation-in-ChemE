    "\\subsection{Gas Compressibility Factor}\n",
    "The gas compressibility factor tells us how much the real gas deviates from the ideal gas at a given pressure and temperature. It is simply defined as the ratio of the molar volume of a gas to the molar volume of an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure, $Z = \\frac{V_{\\text{Actual}}}{V_{\\text{Ideal}}}$. Air is very nearly an ideal gas where $Z=1.0$. In general, deviation from ideal behavior becomes more significant the closer a gas is to a phase change, the lower the temperature, or the larger the pressure. Compressibility factor values are usually obtained by calculation from equations of state (EOS) \\cite{EOS}. The compressibility factor is calculated using the formula:\n",

    "\\subsection{Redlich-Kwong Equation}\n",
    "The Redlich-Kwong equation (RK) of state is a thermodynamic equation that describes the behaviour of fluids as a function of temperature, pressure, and volume. It is particularly useful for modeling the behavior of non-ideal gases and liquids, and it is often used in chemical engineering and process design.\n",
    "The Redlich-Kwong equation of state is expressed as:\n",

    "The Redlich-Kwong-Soave Equation (RKS) equation is a modification of the original Redlich-Kwong equation of state. The RKS equation takes into account the size and shape of the molecules in the fluid, as well as the intermolecular forces between the molecules. This makes it more accurate than the original Redlich-Kwong equation, especially for non-polar fluids.\n",

    "The Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) is an equation of state used to model the thermodynamic behavior of fluids, such as gases and liquids. It was developed by Juan Peng and Donald Robinson in 1976 as an improvement over previous equations of state, such as the Redlich-Kwong equation. The PR EOS takes into account the size and shape of the molecules in the fluid, as well as the intermolecular forces between them. It is particularly useful for fluids that exhibit strong intermolecular attraction, such as polar and hydrogen-bonding fluids.\n",

    "It has several advantages over the original Redlich-Kwong equation of state, including a better ability to describe critical behavior and a more accurate prediction of vapor-liquid equilibria. One limitation of the PR EOS is that it can overestimate the attractive forces between molecules, leading to inaccuracies in predicting properties such as enthalpy and entropy. However, various modifications and extensions to the PR EOS have been developed to address these limitations.\n"

    "The methodology followed in this study is outlined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{enumerate}\n",
    "    \\item \\textbf{Importing Libraries:} Before coding the differential equations, essential library packages were imported at the beginning. \\texttt{NumPy} was imported to operate mathematical arrays and matrices, \\texttt{Matplotlib} was imported to visualize the solved differential equations, and \\texttt{SciPy} was imported to solve the equations of state.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \\item \\textbf{Defining Parameters:} The critical temperature ($T_c$) and critical pressure ($P_c$) of ammonia gas were defined. The temperature of the gas ($T$), the acentric factor of ammonia ($\\omega$), and the ideal gas constant ($R$) were also defined.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \\item \\textbf{Defining EOS Functions:} Three functions denoting Redlich-Kwong (RK), Redlich-Kwong-Soave (RKS), and Peng-Robinson (PR) equations of state were defined. These functions accept the volume ($v$) and pressure ($p$) as parameters. Each function contains the cubic equations corresponding to the respective EOS and returns the cubic equation in terms of $v$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \\item \\textbf{Creating Pressure Range:} A range of values of pressure was created using \\texttt{np.linspace()} from 0 bar to 1000 bar. Then, arrays \\texttt{zcompRK}, \\texttt{zcompRKS}, and \\texttt{zcompPR} were defined and initialized with zeros using \\texttt{np.zeros()} with dimensions equal to the shape of the pressure array.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \\item \\textbf{Solving Equations of State:} A loop was created from range 0 to the shape of the pressure array with a step size of 1. In each iteration, a variable \\texttt{guess} stored the volume of the gas using the ideal gas law. Then, using \\texttt{fsolve()}, three different volumes \\texttt{v} stored the data of the volume obtained from solving the cubic equations called by passing the function name (RK, RKS, or PR). The compressibility factor was calculated using a formula, and the three different $z$ values from different EOS were stored in the arrays \\texttt{zcompRK}, \\texttt{zcompRKS}, and \\texttt{zcompPR}.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \\item \\textbf{Plotting Results:} Finally, the arrays \\texttt{zcompRK}, \\texttt{zcompRKS}, and \\texttt{zcompPR} were plotted against pressure in a single graph. A horizontal line was drawn at $z$ value equals to 1 for the observation of deviation.\n",
